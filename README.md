# Overview of Project

The analysis was centered around a VBA module that iterates through a dataset totaling stock market daily volumes per ticker. In addition, the script captures the starting and closing dollar amount of each stock in order to calculate the total return.

The goal of the analysis was to determine what stocks were doing well and what stocks were decreasing in value.  In order to differentiate between the performing stocks and declining stocks, the script signified tickers with positive returns with a green background while negative returns had a red background.

The goal of the project was to refactor the code for improved maintainability and increased performance.  We want to ensure the code performs well as more data and tickers are added to the dataset.

# Results

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

The stock performance between 2017 and 2018 was drastic.  Year 2017 ended with 11 of 12 stocks with positive returns, the highest almost reaching 200%.  Year 2018 ended with 2 of 12 stocks with positive returns.
